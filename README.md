Check the [**beta**](https://github.com/comigor/artemis/tree/beta) branch for the bleeding edge (and breaking) stuff.

Artemis is a code generator that looks for `schema.graphql` (GraphQL SDL - Schema Definition Language) and `*.graphql` files and builds `.graphql.dart` files typing that query, based on the schema. That's similar to what [Apollo](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client) does (Artemis is his sister anyway).

---

## **Installation**
Add the following to your `pubspec.yaml` file to be able to do code generation:
```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  artemis: '>=7.0.0 <8.0.0'
  build_runner: ^2.1.4
  json_serializable: ^6.0.1
```
The generated code uses the following packages in run-time:
```yaml
dependencies:
  artemis: '>=8.0.0 <8.0.0' # only if you're using ArtemisClient!
  json_annotation: ^4.3.0
  equatable: ^2.0.3
  gql: ^0.13.1-alpha
```

Then run:
```shell
dart pub get
```
or
```shell
flutter pub get
```

Now Artemis will generate the API files for you by running:
```shell
dart run build_runner build
```
or
```shell
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

## **Configuration**
Artemis offers some configuration options to generate code. All options should be included on `build.yaml` file on the root of the project:
```yaml
targets:
  $default:
    builders:
      artemis:
        options:
          # custom configuration options!
```

> ⚠️ Make sure your configuration file is called `build.yaml` (with `.yaml` extension, not `.yml`)!

| Option | Default value | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `generate_helpers` | `true` | If Artemis should generate query/mutation helper GraphQLQuery subclasses. |
| `scalar_mapping` | `[]` | Mapping of GraphQL and Dart types. See [Custom scalars](#custom-scalars). |
| `schema_mapping` | `[]` | Mapping of queries and which schemas they will use for code generation. See [Schema mapping](#schema-mapping). |
| `fragments_glob` | `null` | Import path to the file implementing fragments for all queries mapped in schema_mapping. If it's assigned, fragments defined in schema_mapping will be ignored. |
| `ignore_for_file` | `[]`  | The linter rules to ignore for artemis generated files. |

It's important to remember that, by default, [build](https://github.com/dart-lang/build) will follow [Dart's package layout conventions](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/package-layout), meaning that only some folders will be considered to parse the input files. So, if you want to reference files from a folder other than `lib/`, make sure you've included it on `sources`:
```yaml
targets:
  $default:
    sources:
      - lib/**
      - graphql/**
      - data/**
      - schema.graphql
```

### **Schema mapping**
By default, Artemis won't generate anything. That's because your queries/mutations should be linked to GraphQL schemas. To configure it, you need to point a `schema_mapping` to the path of those queries and schemas:

```yaml
targets:
  $default:
    builders:
      artemis:
        options:
          schema_mapping:
            - output: lib/graphql_api.graphql.dart
              schema: lib/my_graphql_schema.graphql
              queries_glob: lib/**.graphql
```

Each `SchemaMap` is configured this way:

| Option | Default value | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `output` | | Relative path to output the generated code. It should end with `.graphql.dart` or else the generator will need to generate one more file. |
| `schema` | | Relative path to the GraphQL schema. |
| `queries_glob` | | Glob that selects all query files to be used with this schema. |
| `naming_scheme` | `pathedWithTypes` | The naming scheme to be used on generated classes names. `pathedWithTypes` is the default for retrocompatibility, where the names of previous types are used as prefix of the next class. This can generate duplication on certain schemas. With `pathedWithFields`, the names of previous fields are used as prefix of the next class and with `simple`, only the actual GraphQL class nameis considered. |
| `type_name_field` | `__typename` | The name of the field used to differentiate interfaces and union types (commonly `__typename` or `__resolveType`). Note that `__typename` field are not added automatically to the query. If you want interface/union type resolution, you need to manually add it there or set `append_type_name` to `true`. |
| `append_type_name` | `false` | Appends `type_name_field` value to the query selections set. |
| `fragments_glob` | `null` | Import path to the file implementing fragments for all queries mapped in schema_mapping. |

See [examples](./example) for more information and configuration options.

### **Custom scalars**

If your schema uses custom scalars, they must be defined on `build.yaml`. If it needs a custom parser (to decode from/to json), the `custom_parser_import` path must be set and the file must implement both `fromGraphQL___ToDart___` and `fromDart___ToGraphQL___` constant functions.

`___ToDart___` and `___ToGraphQL___` should be named including nullability, here is an example:

* `file: Upload` => `fromGraphQLUploadNullableToDartMultipartFileNullable`
and `fromDartMultipartFileNullableToGraphQLUploadNullable`
* `file: Upload!` => `fromGraphQLUploadToDartMultipartFile` and `fromDartMultipartFileToGraphQLUpload`
* `file: [Upload]` => `fromGraphQLListNullableUploadNullableToDartListNullableMultipartFileNullable`
and `fromDartListNullableMultipartFileNullableToGraphQLListNullableUploadNullable`
* `file: [Upload]!` => `fromGraphQLListUploadNullableToDartListMultipartFileNullable`
and `fromDartListMultipartFileNullableToGraphQLListUploadNullable`
* `file: [Upload!]!` => `fromGraphQLListUploadToDartListMultipartFile` and `fromDartListMultipartFileToGraphQLListUpload`

```yaml
targets:
  $default:
    builders:
      artemis:
        options:
          scalar_mapping:
            - custom_parser_import: 'package:graphbrainz_example/coercers.dart'
              graphql_type: Date
              dart_type: DateTime
```

If your custom scalar needs to import Dart libraries, you can provide it in the config as well:

```yaml
targets:
  $default:
    builders:
      artemis:
        options:
          scalar_mapping:
            - custom_parser_import: 'package:graphbrainz_example/coercers.dart'
              graphql_type: BigDecimal
              dart_type:
                name: Decimal
                imports:
                  - 'package:decimal/decimal.dart'
```

Each `ScalarMap` is configured this way:

| Option | Default value | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `graphql_type` |  | The GraphQL custom scalar name on schema. |
| `dart_type` |  | The Dart type this custom scalar should be converted from/to. |
| `custom_parser_import` | `null` | Import path to the file implementing coercer functions for custom scalars. See [Custom scalars](#custom-scalars). |

See [examples](./example) for more information and configuration options.

## **ArtemisClient**
If you have `generate_helpers`, Artemis will create a subclass of `GraphQLQuery` for you, this class can be used
in conjunction with `ArtemisClient`.

```dart
final client = ArtemisClient('/graphql');
final gitHubReposQuery = MyGitHubReposQuery();
final response = await client.execute(gitHubReposQuery);
```

`ArtemisClient` adds type-awareness around `Link` from [`package:gql/link`](https://pub.dev/packages/gql).
You can create `ArtemisClient` from any `Link` using `ArtemisClient.fromLink`.
 
Check the [examples](./example) to see how to use it in details.
